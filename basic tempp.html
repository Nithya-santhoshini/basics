        <p  style="font-family:verdana;">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation</p>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;">Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

        </center>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;">In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox. 
            The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions. </p>

        <h2 style="background-color: brown;""><i>FEATURES</i></h2>
        </center>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;">Python provides many useful features which make it popular and valuable from the other programming languages. It supports object-oriented programming, procedural programming approaches and provides dynamic memory allocation. We have listed below a few essential features.</p>
        <ul style="font-family: verdana;">
            <li>Easy to Learn and Use</li>
            <li>Expressive Language</li>
            <li>Interpreted Language</li>
            <li>Cross-platform Language</li>
            <li>Free and Open Source</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented Language</li>
            <li>Extensible</li>
            <li>Large Standard Library</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="background-color:greenyellow;"><i>APPLICATIONS</i></h2>
        </center>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;" >Python is known for its general-purpose nature that makes it applicable in almost every domain of software development. Python makes its presence in every emerging field. It is the fastest-growing programming language and can develop any application.

            Here, we are specifying application areas where Python can be applied.</p>
